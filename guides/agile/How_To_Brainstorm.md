# How to do a brainstorming

Before starting a brainstorming session everybody should agree to theses rules:

- Quantity then quality - tell all your thoughts and ideas - even the most foolish ones are welcome, no self censorship
- Be scandalous, funny, wild, creative
- Build your ideas on other peopleâ€™s ideas
- No judgment, no evaluation, no critics - discussion comes later
- Show and read your post-its for everybody

## How do we do the brainstorming ?

- On remote : Meet/skype/TeamViewer/orwhatever + screenshare of your Trello Board / OrWhatEverYouUse
- Onsite : Juste a wall and post-its
- You create as many cards as you want to (you can propose silent brainstorming for some minutes)
- Then each participant reads the post-it and explains his/her thoughts.

## What 2 Do ?

- Then you can create up to 6 categories where to put / organize the trello cards or post-its.
- Dot-Voting : Everybody has three votes and then you choose the three favorit categories
- Choose concret actions for each category, give a maintainer and a date
