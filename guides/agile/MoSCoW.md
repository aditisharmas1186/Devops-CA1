The MoSCoW method is a way for a group of people to prioritize and organize requirements for a project. MoSCoW is an acronym which stands for Must have, Should have, Could have and Won’t have. 

Must Have:
	These are the parts of the project that absolutely must be included. They are non-negotiable requirements that must be included so that, if the project was made of all 'Must Have' components, the project would be successful.

Should Have:
	These are requirements that are important, however they come in second priority to the 'Must Have' requirements. If there is time, these requirements will most likely be added.

Could Have:
	These are requirements that would be nice to have, however it is more than likely that there will not be enough time to include them. 

Won’t Have:
	These requirements could be added at a future date but are not crucial to the success of the project at this time.
