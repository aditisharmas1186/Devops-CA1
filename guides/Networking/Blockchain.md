# Blockchain

The [**blockchain**][1] is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. In 2008, [Satoshi Nakamoto][2] invented it to serve as the public transaction ledger of the [cryptocurrency][3]. Many people think of blockchain as the technology that powers [bitcoin][4]. While the original purpose of blockchain is to power bitcoin, still it is capable of so much more. In fact, blockchain is shorthand for a whole suite of distributed ledger technologies that can be programmed to record and track anything of value!

**BUT!**… we already have processes in place to track data. What’s so special about **Blockchain**?

###### Let’s break down the reasons why blockchain technology stands to revolutionalize the way we interact with each other!

#### 1. The way it tracks and stores data

Blockchain stores information in a so-called called blocks which are linked together in a chronological fashion to form a continuous line vis-a-vis **the metaphorical chain of blocks**! If we make a change to the information recorded in a particular block, we don't have to rewrite it. Instead, the change is stored in a new block registering that particular data and time permanently. Sounds familiar? That's because blockchain is based on the centuries-old method of the general financial ledger. But unlike the age-old ledger method, blockchain was designed to be decentralized and distributed across a large [peer-to-peer][5] (**P2P**) network of computers which reduces the ability for data tampering!

#### 2. It creates trust in the data

Before adding a block to the chain a few things must happen. First, a cryptographic puzzle must be solved thus creating the block. Secondly, the computer that solves the puzzle shares the solution to all the other computers on the network. This is called [proof-of-work][6]. The P2P network will then verify this proof-of-work and if correct, the block will be added to the chain. The combination of these complex math puzzles and verification by end users build the foundation for trusting each and every block on the chain. Because the network does the trust building for us we now have the opportunity to interact directly with our data in real-time.

#### 3. No more intermediaries

Currently, when doing business with one another, we don’t show the other person our financial or business records. Instead, we rely on trusted intermediaries, such as a bank or a lawyer, to view our records and keep that information confidential. These intermediaries build trust between the parties and are able to verify! But blockchain cut out the intermediaries as we now know all blocks added to the chain have been verified to be true and can’t be tampered with! This type of trusted P2P interaction with our data can revolutionize the way we access, verify and transact with one another because blockchain can be implemented in many different ways as its a type of technology, and not a single network. Some blockchain can be completely public and open to everyone to view and access while others are limited to a group of authorized users such as your company, a group of banks or government agencies. And there are hybrid public-private blockchains too.

## Applications

Some of the most crucial applications of blockchain technology are as follows:

- **Cryptocurrency**
- **Financial Services**
- **Smart Property**
- **Smart Contracts**
