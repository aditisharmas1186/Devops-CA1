Creating Markdown Files
=======================

For those of you who are #super# new to coding you might find that there are very simple and common things that just you are just learning about. For me a Markdown file was one that was new to me. 

A markdown file is a type of text file that allows for simple and non-intrusive formatting so that it can be read both as a plain text document and a formatted document. 

To create a .md file open a front end IDE platform like Atom and create a new file with the .md extension. The next step is to familurize yourself with some of the formatting. I found the documentation on this site https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics. An example of some of the formatting can be seen in a text editor below. 

Best of Luck, and keep on coding!

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.
