# Flask
flask is modern light weight web framework which is written in python.Since it does not require any tools or libraries (external) therefore it is also termed as microframework. It does not have its own components therefore it is light weight. By component we can understand in terms of data abstraction layer,form validation etc which you can see in Django if you are a hard code django lover till now .The core functionality is available from pre-existing libraries but if we want to extend the functionality we can easily do so with the help of extensions.There are many extensions which are available to add them to core flask ,few of them including form validaton,Object relational mappers etc.
## Installation
To install flask just open up your terminal or command prompt (in case of windows users) and type the following command
```python
pip install Flask
```
If you want to experience and hack the latest release you can just head over to this [link](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/1.0.2/)
To update your package just type the following command
```python
pip install -U Flask
```
The github repo of the flask can be found [here](https://github.com/pallets/flask).Feel free to contribute if you are interested.
The flask [documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/) is well maintained and if you are looking for a guide to learn it then this is the best start.
## Some more stuffs to grab
* Advantages of using extensions lies behind the fact that these third party extensions are continuously updated rather than core libraries
* Scaling of complex applications is quick and easy in flask
* It is based on two projects Jinja and Werkzeug
## Flask vs Django
To choose Flask over Django or vice versa ,you need to be pretty familiar about them a little more ,so rather than reinventing the wheel you can visit the [link](https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/flask-vs-django-why-flask-might-be-better-4xs7mdf8v#quick-comparison) and learn more about them and after reading this you can decide which one to choose for your next web application.
