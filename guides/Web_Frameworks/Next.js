# Next.js
Next.js is javascript framework which is basically designed for server side rendering of the content.It is used to simplify the application development using javascript.It is a React based framework therefore used along with React to develop web apps in a matter of few hours. It saves a lot of developer efforts and time. 

In building javascript applications which require client side routing and other actions required to be done at client side, and one more problem arose that of SEO because javacript need to be loaded before content and this could result in increase in page loading time.The solution to both of those problems is server rendering, also called static pre-rendering.

*  Itâ€™s advertised by its creators as a zero-configuration, single-command toolchain for React apps.
*  Its combination with React makes it skyrocketing and thus it is increasingly used now rather than React alone.
*  Application building is as simple as that in case of webapps build using php
*  It provides a common structure that allows you to easily build a frontend React application, and transparently handle server-side rendering for you.
