# Naive Bayes Classifier

**Naive Bayes** is a simple but surprisingly powerful algorithm for predictive modeling whereas [Naive Bayes Classifiers][1] are a family of 'probabilistic classifiers' based on applying Bayes' theorem. The use of [Bayes' Theorem][2] in the classifier's decision rule is trivial, but Naive Bayes is not necessarily a Bayesian method. The whole concept of Naive Bayes classification revolves around **maximum likelihood** & it serves as a foundation for many other supervised machine learning algorithms!

###### Some of the applications are --

- Real-time Prediction
- Text classification
- Spam Filtering
- Recommendation System

## Bayes' Theorem

Bayesâ€™ Theorem is useful when working with conditional probabilities, because it provides us with a way to reverse them. Here's the mathematical formula:

###### Being Naive!

After calculating the probabilities for every factor, **Naive Bayes Classifier** then selects the outcome with the highest probability. This classifier assumes that every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. Hence the word '**naive**'!

## Interpretations of Naive Bayes

> The different Naive Bayes classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make regarding the distribution of P(A | B)

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes** -- In Gaussian Naive Bayes, continuous values associated with each feature are assumed to be distributed according to a Gaussian distribution aka Normal distribution. Plotting a graph for such a distribution provides a bell shaped curve symmetric about the mean of the feature values!

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** -- Feature vectors represent the frequencies with which certain events have been generated by a multinomial distribution. This is the event model typically used for document classification.

- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** -- Bernoulli Naive Bayes is for independent binary features only. Like the multinomial model, this model is also popular for document classification tasks; where we treat a feature as if binary-constructed viz. whether a word occurs in a document or not!
