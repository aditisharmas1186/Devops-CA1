## Syntactic Parsing

Syntactic parsing is the process of analysing words for grammar and arranging them such that the relationship between them is 
shown. Its attributes include dependency and part of speech tags-
- Dependency is analysis of binary relations between 2 lexical items or words. Each relation is represented in the form of triplets(
  relation,governor,dependent)

- Part of Speech tagging or POS tagging - This helps in identifying each word of the sentenceas a noun,pronoun,adjective and so on.
  It is used to improve word features and converting a word to its base(for example swimming,swam are derived from same word, swim).
  It can also be used to removed stopwords(repeatable words that are not required for analysis like 'the','if' etc) 
  
Motivations for syntactic parsing include machine translation, speech recognition, grammar checking, relation extraction, and question answering.
