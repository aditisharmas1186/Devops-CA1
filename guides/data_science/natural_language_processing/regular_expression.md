# Regular Expression
Regular expressions (also known as RegEx or RegExp) is used to match characters in a string based on some patterns.The definition just described seems little tricky to some,so let us understand it with an example.
Let us consider a string which stores url of your favourite website i.e string s = "https://www.google.com" and suppose you are given a pattern which is string regex = "https" (remember i am writting regex pattern just like a normal string, actually syntax is explained later).Now suppose if you want to check if the above pattern of characters is present in the string or not.In the above case the answer is yes.

Another use case which all of us might have experienced is that when we signup for any portal or forum etc we are required to choose a password with some constraints.This constraints are basically held behind with regular expression.

 Now we have scratched the surface but remember it is only the tip of the iceberg rest it yet to hack into it.
 
 ## I'm too excited now ,from where shall i learn it??
 
 There are thousands(or even more) of tutorials available on the web if you just search for it.I shall reference down few of them which one might find useful in getting a good start and enjoy the learning experience.

 ## Purpose
 Regular expressions are used in search engines,search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors.Many programming languages provide regex capabilities, built-in or via libraries. 
 
 # Regular Expression in Lexical Analyzer
 The following guide will explain how to use regular expression in lexical analysis.Basically regular expression is used to make scanners which is helpful in finding the tokens from the input string.We can even make more complex scanner to even parse the XML documents.A detailed guided can be found below

## Conclusion
This is just a beginner guide to regular expression and is only a kickstart.More is yet to go through
