# AntiPatterns  

Introduction

Frequently while learning software engineering, you will hear many terms that may be new to you. One term that will be used is AntiPatterns. An AntiPattern is a solution to a problem that is considered counterproductive. That is not to say it is not a solution, but rather a better solution exists. Being able to identify AntiPatterns will aide a developer in creating efficient and flexible code.


## An Example
**Scenario**: A recent release brought a bug to the surface. Management is very displeased and demands immediate action.
**Response**: You identify the issue and apply a *quick-fix solution* that is rather *inflexible*. Your change will not allow for changes within that block to occur without causing further issues.


This is an example of the BandAid AntiPattern. The developer applies the quickest and easiest fix, rather than exploring to find the best solution. This will most likely result in recusion. To avoid falling victim to the BandAid, the developer should explore possible solutions and find the most flexible and least dependent solution possible. There are many AntiPatterns and they should be an area of study for continuous improvement. There are even language specific AntiPatterns.
