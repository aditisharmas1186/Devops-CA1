## OVERVIEW:

MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program (stores data as a "document" inside a collection) written in C++. It is a leading NoSQL database which works on terminologies that include database,collection and document. It is currently used by thousands of top organizations like Source Forge, Craigslist,eBay, Viacom, Foursquare and The New York Times   
### CORE COMPONENTS OF MongoDB:
**Mongod:** It handles data requests,manages data access and performs background data management operations.

**Mongos:** It determines the location of the data in shard cluster in order to complete commanded operations.

**Mongo:** It provides an interface to test queries and operation in the databases directly.
### KEY FEATURES OF MongoDB:
#### SHARDING IN MongoDB:
One of the most extinguishing features of MongoDB is the process of sharding.It is the process of storing data records across multiple machines.Upon increasing the data size a single machine may not be able to store data,here comes the concept of sharding.It's an attempt of MongoDB to meet the demands of data growth.
#### REPLICATION IN MongoDB:
Replication is the process of keeping identical copies of data on multiple servers to keep applications running and data safe.
#### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHARDING AND REPLICATION:
The shard provides the ability to partition the data and store it across multiple servers.So the resources are not limited to a single machine. Replication on the other hand, is a duplicate copy of the data in full to be used in case of hardware failure.
### OTHER FEATURES OF MongoDB
Document-oriented,File storage,Server-side JavaScript execution,Capped collections

### ADVANTAGES OF USING MongoDB 

It finds application in Bigdata,Datahub,Mobile Infrastructure Development,User Data Management.
One doesn't need much time to design database.
It is scalable and consistent in nature  It offers us freedom to run anywhere.
