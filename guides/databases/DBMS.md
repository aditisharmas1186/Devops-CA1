# Database Management System

A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains inter-related information. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.

As opposed to the traditional file system used to manage data using files in hard disk, database management systems help overcome a number of issues such as - 
* Data redundancy and inconsistency
* Difficulty in accessing data
* Atomicity problems
* Integrity problems
* Concurrent access anomalies
* Security problems

### Database Languages

A database system provides a **data-definition language** to specify the database schema and a **data-manipulation language** to express database queries and updates. In practice, the data-definition and data-manipulation languages are not two separate languages; instead they simply form parts of a single database language, such as the widely used SQL.
