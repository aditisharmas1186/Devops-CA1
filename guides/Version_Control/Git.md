# Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source version control system. It tracks changes to specific versions of code so that previous versions can be recalled and reinstated at a later date. It also makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same files without the risk of overwriting othersâ€™ work or losing files.

Git runs at the command line or through a git interface on your local machine. It keeps track of and maintains files in something called a ***repository*** or ***repo***. A key feature of Git is the ability to make branches. A ***branch*** is a separate copy of the source code that allows a user to try new features and implement code without directly affecting the master branch. When a branch has successfully implemented a revision, it can be ***merged*** back into the master branch. The revision is then officially a part of the original project.

There are also Repository Management Services which store and share Git repositories online. The most popular are:
* [GitHub](/guides/Version_Control/GitHub.md)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
