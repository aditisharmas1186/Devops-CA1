## Git vs Mercurial
### Pros of git
1. git stores commits using an commit hash while mercurial does maintain only logs appended in the disk thus the unique commit hash in git being immutable results in a cleaner history.
2. git provides more safety feature to prevent destructive actions when one tries to rewrite history.
3. With git it is easier to go back to earlier commits and do relevant changes than mercurial.
4. Branching in git is much better and killer feature as we don't need to clone the repo again for each new branch as in case of mercurial.
5. No staging area in mercurial although the feature is available in the form of extensions but it is not fully fledged like that of git
