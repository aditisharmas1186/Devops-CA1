# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular hosting and version control system for source code and [Git](/guides/Version_Control/Git.md) repositories online. In addition to features of Git such as branching and merging, GitHub also provides its own unique features. Some of these features include:
* Issue Tracking
* Documentation and Wikis
* Detailed Code Reviews and Commit History
* Insights: Special analytics detailing project traffic, trends, etc.

GitHub can be used in collaboration with Git on your local machine, through its graphical user interface [GitHub Desktop]( https://desktop.github.com/), or entirely through the browser. It offers both private and public repositories. A private repository is a safe way to back-up your files, and a public repository opens up your code to be reviewed by the community. Making your source code public on GitHub allows for people from all over the world to collaborate on your project. As a result, GitHub is frequently used to host open-source projects.
