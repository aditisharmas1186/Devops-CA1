# Jira

Jira is a project management and issue tracking software developed by Atlassian, that can be used in the cloud, or self-hosted. 

## Why use it?

You can use Jira to track issues and bugs, but also to plan new features, get feedback and discuss issues, plan and track work, manage released and review performance.

Using Jira to track bugs, issues, feature requests and planned enhancements helps developers by:

* Reminding you what needs to be done
* Prioritize issues in order of importance
* Add extra information 
* Keep a record of the work being done to fix an issue
* Discuss ideas
* Keep track of who is working on what

If you are working in a team, you can quickly see what stage a bug or new feature is at, by checking the issue. You can even subscribe to updates, and get an email notification when something changes.

## Features

### Issue Tracking

The primary feature is to track your issues and bugs. Add an issue, and it can be assigned to someone in your team to fix. You can search, filter and comment on issues, and discuss how best to get them resolved.

You can also use labels, status, and time tracking on issues.

### Planning

You can use the board view to organise your issues into lists, or just to move issues along from planned, to in development, to completed. You can also use scrum style boards to set up a sprint and rank issues.

Organising your issues in boards helps you see clearly what stage each issue is at towards getting resolved.

### Releases

You can see what stage different versions of your software are at, in development or released. You can also maintain different versions at the same time, for different clients for example.

### Reports

Report are available for a graphical overview, like charts and graphs.
