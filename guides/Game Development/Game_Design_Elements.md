# Elements of Game Design
Here are some questions you should answer when designing a game, as explained by game designer [Tracy Fullerton](https://www.tracyfullerton.com/):

## Players
What form does the player assume when playing this game? Do they play alone or with others? If they compete with other players, do they compete as an individual or as part of a team?

E.g. Mario Party - you can play as different characters from the Mario Universe and compete with other players as an individual.

## Objectives/goals
What is the #1 rule to winning the game? What conditions cause the player to win - or lose - the game? How do the player's actions lead to these conditions?

E.g. Mario Party - Collect the most stars to win. Collect the stars by stealing from others or earning enough coins to buy them.

## Procedures
What are the core mechanics (verbs) of the game? What types/patterns of play are allowed by the rules defined?

E.g. Mario Party - Take turns rolling the die to move around the board, play minigames, and collect items.

## Rules
How is the game played with defined challenges, actions, goals, and termination conditions? How can the environment, objects, and NPCs hinder or benefit the player?

E.g. Mario Party - Star spaces may move when an event is triggered or an item is used. In minigames, a player may die if they fall into a pit or are hit by fire.

## Conflicts
How do the procedures and rules make it difficult for the player to achieve their goal(s)? In other words, how do they challenge the player?

E.g. Mario Party - The environment may have physical barriers to prevent you from getting to the star. Other players can gain items that will sabotage your attempts to get the most stars.

## Boundaries
How do you separate the game world from everything outside of the game? How do you feel like you're in a game?

E.g. Mario Party - You can only move on the spaces within the board and not walk off of the board.

## Outcome
What outcomes can the player have? How many ways can they win or lose? Can the player actually "win" or "lose"?

E.g. Mario Party - The player with the most stars wins, and the others lose. If more than one player has the same number of stars, then the player with the most coins wins.
