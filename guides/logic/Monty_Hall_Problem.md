## Overview
The **Monty Hall problem** is a probability puzzle credited to statistician [Steve Selvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Selvin), made famous by game show host Monty Hall. Steve published the puzzle and the solution in [The American Statistician](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?journalCode=utas20), a scientific journal in 1975.

## The Puzzle
Suppose that there are three doors. There is a car behind one of the doors, and goats behind the other two doors. You, as a contestant, do not know which door holds which. You are asked to pick a door. Let's say you pick door 1. The host, who knows what's behind each of the doors, opens one of the other doors, say door 3, to reveal a goat. Now you are given the option of switching your choice from door 1 to door 2. Does switching your choice increase your probability of winning the car?

## Controversy
The solution provided by Steve in 1975 and later in 1990 by [Marilyn vos Savant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant) generated a lot of controversy and made the puzzle famous throughout the world. A number of articles and papers were published on the puzzle. Mathematicians and PhDs provided formal  proofs and computer simulations in support of the solution.

## Solution
Consider the problem carefully. Your first choice, door 1, gives you a 1/3rd chance of winning the car. If you consider the other two doors as a set (door 2 and door 3), the chances of finding the car behind one of those doors is 2/3rd. Now the host opens one of those doors to reveal the goat. So the other door still retains the 2/3rd probability while your original choice has just a 1/3rd probability. So it is to your advantage to switch to door 2.
