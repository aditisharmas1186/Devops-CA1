**The Testing Pyramid**

Testing is always going to be an important part of any project, whether your team actually has any QA staff or not. Following the concept of the testing pyramid will help your team to find defects deep in the code sooner.

The concept of the testing pyramid from a QA perspective is that you want to test as far down the pyramid as you can.  The further down the pyramid you start testing, the deeper into the code you are.

**The Bottom of the Pyramid**

This would be where developers (or testers who can program and understand the code) would write unit tests for the code. This is testing the code at its deepest level.

**The Middle of the Pyramid**

This would be where you can test at an API level using any tool of your choice,such as Postman. This is testing the integration, making sure the API integration works as expected, etc. This is typically done by testers.

**The Top of the Pyramid**

This would be where you would be testing the UI of an application. This would also where you can do UX tests, testing the application as a user would. At this level you can do a mix of manual testing and automation for any area that makes sense.
