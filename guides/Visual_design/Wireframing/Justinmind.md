# Justinmind

Justinmind is a high-fidelity wireframing/prototyping tool that allows developers to plan what their mobile app/website will look like. Unlike low-fidelity tools, Justinmind allows for the creation of a wireframe that will look, feel and operate just like the final product. It is useful for beginners as it does not require any coding knowledge, and is as simple as drag-and-drop whichever feature to the spot on the design you would like it to go.
