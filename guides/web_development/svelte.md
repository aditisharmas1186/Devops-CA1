## WHAT EXACTLY SVELTE IS

svelte got popular around 2019 with it's latest svelte 3 release.
svelte is not a UI framework like angular or vue nor a library like UI react. Svelte is a compiler .svelte comes with a design pattern that is similar to vue.js design template. in production, svelte takes your code and makes a bundle.js file and other instruction files which does not have any extra code that is injected as other frameworks do. That bundle.js will be then shipped and execute on runtime. Because of that, svelte code is really small in size compared to other frameworks. with a small bundle size, svelte applications will load faster, enhancing the user experience.
