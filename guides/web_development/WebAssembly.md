## Wasm

[WebAssembly][1] (or Wasm) is a new portable, size as well as load-time efficient format suitable for compilation to the web. It is meant to execute code as nearly as fast as native machine code. Till now, we had been using [JavaScript][2] as the primary programming language in browsers for web development but it is not a compiled language and thus doesn't provide as much effieciency in terms of speed as compiled ones do! With WebAssembly, one can implement performance critical stuff & import it like a standard JavaScript module. Thus, WebAssembly is not meant to replace JS but to complement it wherever and whenever necessary.

## Pros

#### Languages Supported

- C/C++ (production ready support)
- Rust (good support)
- Java, C# (experimental support)

#### Advantages

- Efficient & Fast
- Safe
- Open & Debuggable
- Open Web Platform

## And JS?

**We need WebAssembly** because as flexible as JavaScript is, itâ€™s still too hard to express many of the things we may want to in JavaScript, and the features we would need to make it easy might add complexity to a language that already confuses many users.

## Future

Wasm is a Google, Microsoft, Apple & Mozilla initiave that is intended to build a faster web. It's all open source so hop in, just read the docs & get started. Here's some useful resources:
